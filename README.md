# ENTNT_Technical-Assignment Technical Assignment: Calendar Application for Communication Tracking 
---------------- Objective --------------------------- 
As a company, we aim to maintain strong professional relationships by keeping accurate records of our interactions with other organizations. The objective of this assignment is to develop a React-based Calendar Application that enables us to efficiently track communication with companies, ensuring follow-ups are timely and consistent. This tool will provide a centralized platform to log past interactions, plan future communications, and manage the frequency of engagement based on predefined schedules. The application will include: •	An Admin Module for setting up companies and communication parameters. •	A User Module for visualizing, managing, and performing communication tasks. •	A Reporting and Analytics Module for actionable insights (optional). It is critical to emphasize usability, clarity, and efficient data handling.
